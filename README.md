# Description

This package contains the datasets, experimental results, and source code of the paper *Comparing Multi-Objective Surrogate Models for Binary Petroleum Well Placement*, submitted to the IEEE Andescon 2024 conference. The following directories are included:

- datasets: contains the datasets (from D1 to D5) used in the experiments.
- experimental_results: contains the complete experimental results.
- source_code: contains the source code for the experimental setup, with the Python code (in a Jupyter Notebook) that was used to evaluate the surrogate models.

Please note that this is a temporary anonymous repository for the blind-review process. If the paper is accepted, the content of this repository will be moved to a public definitive repository where the authors can be identified.
